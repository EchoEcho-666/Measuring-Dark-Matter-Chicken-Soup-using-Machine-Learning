# Measuring-Dark-Matter-Chicken-Soup-using-Machine-Learning
McGill 2024 Physics Hackathon 2024

## ðŸ§  Project Overview
This project analyzes astronomical survey data using machine learning techniques to estimate the matter power spectrum and study the distribution of dark matter in the universe. It was developed during the 2024 McGill Physics Hackathon.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, SciPy, AstroPy, Matplotlib
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, Jupyter Notebook

## Results & Visualizations
The project was developed as a first attempt to apply machine learning to cosmological datasets. While we explored the structure of the BOSS and LIM datasets and began preprocessing the matter power spectra, we were unable to complete model training within the hackathon time constraints.

Key takeaways included experience working with astronomical data, understanding data normalization and structure, and learning the setup process for ML pipelines using SciPy and AstroPy.
